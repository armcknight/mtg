A project to help manage my collection of Magic: the Gathering cards.

The collection is contained in multiple CSV files:

- base list of stored collection not currently in use
- a list for each constructed deck

# TODO

- [ ] Ingest a CSV from the TCGPlayer iOS app containing scanned cards
- Given input CSV, perform any combination of appending to or subtracting from:
    - [ ] base list
    - [ ] constructed list
